# BARZ: Barrier Zones for Adversarial Example Defense
Code corresponding to the Barrier Zone (BARZ) defense paper.
The original ResNet code from which the BARZ code is built on is written by Yerlan Idelbayev can be found here: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py

MODELS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN JAN 2022: We are currently working to port our existing defense from TF 1.X to PyTorch. Trained models will be made available as soon as possible. Please check back soon.
